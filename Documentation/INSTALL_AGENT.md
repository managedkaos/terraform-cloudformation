# Install the Datadog Agent

1. Start with an SSH session to one of the EC2 instances.

1. On the datadog console, select `Integrations -> Agents`.

1. Review the available agents:
    - Modern operating systmems like MacOS and Windows
    - Several versions of Linux
    - And many common devleopment tools like Docker and Kubernetes

1. Click `Amazon Linux`.

1. Explain that we need  to use an API key for the installation.

1. Click `Select API Key`.

1. Explain that we will create a new key for the agents.  This will allow us to rotate the Agent key without affect the key we used for the AWS account integration.

1. Click `+Create New`; Name the key `Datadog Agent`.

1. Click `Use API Key`.

1. Under New installation, note that the `DD_API_KEY` environment variable has been filled in with the API key we selected.

1. All we need to do is copy the prepopulated string for a one-step installation.

1. With the mouse, highlight the string, `mouse right-click` -> `copy`.

1. Go to the window with the SSH session.

1. Elevate the session to root with `sudo su -`.

1. With the mouse, `mouse right-click` -> `paste`.

1. The installation should begin and then complete without error.

1. Explain that the datadog agent is installed as a service and can be controlled with the `systemctl` command.

1. Run `systemctl status datadog-agent`.

1. Clear the screen by typing `clear`.

1. Explain that there is also a datadog-agent command line interface.

1. Clear the screen by typing `clear`.

1. Run `datadog-agent status | more`.

1. Explain how this gives more specific details on the status of the agent and the data being sent to datadog.

1. Now let's configure the agent.

1. `cd` to `/etc/datadog-agent` and run `ls`.

1. Explain that this is the directory that the agent uses to store configurations for the agent itself and any application specific integrations.

1. Edit `datadog.yaml` with `vim`.

1. Explain that the hostname can be set using the hostname configuration.

1. Search for `/hostname:/`.

1. Uncomment the line and replace `<HOSTNAME_NAME>` with `webserver-1`.

1. Explain that now the process collection needs to be enabled.

1. Search for `/process_config/`.

1. Explain that we need to make three changes to enable process collection.

    1. First, uncomment the line `# process_config:`.
    1. Then, uncomment the line `# process_collection:`.
    1. And last, uncomment the line `# enabled: false`.

1. Replace `false` with `true`.

1. Save the file and exit the editor.

1. Explain that the datadog agent service needs to be restarted to pick up the new configuration.

1. Run `systemctl restart datadog-agent`.

1. Explain that the updated configuration can be checked using `datadog-agent hostname`.  The output of this command should show the name assigned in the configuration, `webserver-1`.

1. Run `datadog-agent hostname` and observe the output.

1. See the complete configuration without comments using the command: `grep -vE "^$|#" datadog.yaml`:w

1. Go back to the datadog console.

1. Duplicated hosts when installing the Agent...
    If you manually set the hostname in the Agentâ€™s configuration, you might see duplicated names on the Datadog infrastructure list and map pages for a few hours. The duplicate hosts disappear a few hours later, and does not affect your billing.
